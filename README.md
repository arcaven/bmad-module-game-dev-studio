# GDS - BMAD Game Development Suite

![](docs/bmgd-logo.png)

BMAD Game Development Suite (GDS) brings the power of BMAD's project planning and structured development to game development. Create working prototypes quickly in three of the industry's leading 3D engines (Unity, Unreal, and Godot) or whatever platform you like. GDS will lead you through product research, technical design, narrative design, and a full epic-driven production cycle, developed by game industry veterans off of BMAD Method's core.

Sound like *too much* power? You can also use GDS to quickly prototype an idea, skipping most of the planning steps and going straight into breaking things in your engine of choice!

## What can BMGD do?

GDS, out of the box, contains support for game development and testing in:

* [Unity](https://unity.com)
* [Unreal](https://www.unrealengine.com/)
* [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)

However, these engines *aren't a requirement* - if you want to make a roguelike in pure C, BMGD can handle it.  The GDS process will guide you through every step of creating a game project, all the way to release.

As for what kind of games you can create? GDS has support for *21* game types, from turn-based strategy to visual novels to survival games. And if your game idea doesn't fit in any one of those, that's fine, too.

## What can't GDS do?

With very few simple exceptions, *GDS cannot create an entire game from scratch for you.* 

GDS is designed to work with *coding agents* such as Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, or Github Copilot. There are *many* aspects of game development that are outside the scope of these agents - such as art assets such as models and textures, animations, music, and sound effects. GDS can work to integrate these into your chosen engine, but it *can't* create them. 

As such, it's designed to be part of your development team, not a one-stop solution for creating a game.

## What do I need to do to begin?

To install GDS, just select it as part of the BMAD Method install. To update it, simply re-install BMAD Method.

* Follow this walkthrough TODO! to install GDS and create your first project.
* Read this tutorial TODO! on using Quick-Dev to create a prototype quickly
* Consult the tomes of documentation TODO! on all the functionality GDS has to offer.

## This is a lot! Can I get some help?

Absolutely! The best place to get help is on our friendly BMAD Method Discord. There's a specific GDS forum (link TODO!!) where the developers and other GDS users will be glad to help out!
