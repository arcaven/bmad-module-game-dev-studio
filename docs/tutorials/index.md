Complete guides for the BMad Game Development Module (BMGD) — AI-powered workflows for game design and development.

## Getting Started

**New to BMGD?** Start here:

Install BMGD module → Game Brief → GDD → Architecture → Build

## Game Development Phases

BMGD follows four phases aligned with game development:

### Phase 1: Preproduction
- Brainstorm Game - Ideation with game-specific techniques
- Game Brief - Capture vision, market, and fundamentals

### Phase 2: Design
- GDD (Game Design Document) - Comprehensive game design
- Narrative Design - Story, characters, world (for story-driven games)

### Phase 3: Technical
- Game Architecture - Engine, systems, patterns, structure

### Phase 4: Production
- Sprint Planning - Epic and story management
- Story Development - Implementation workflow
- Code Review - Quality assurance
- Testing - Automated tests, playtesting, performance
- Retrospective - Continuous improvement

## Choose Your Path

**Start a new game project**
- Run `brainstorm-game` for ideation
- Create a Game Brief with `create-brief`

**Design my game**
- Create a GDD with `create-gdd`
- If story-heavy, add Narrative Design with `create-narrative`

**Plan the technical architecture**
- Run `create-architecture` with the Game Architect

**Build my game**
- Use Phase 4 production workflows
- Follow the sprint-based development cycle
